## Project Objective
- Flight delays are a modern-day problem. Passengers, airlines, and airports all suffer from these delays, which are inconvenient and costly.
- This project analyzes flight delay data in order to gain a better understanding of how commercial aviation operates and to anticipate when delays are likely. 

## Research Questions
### We've compiled a list of potential questions that the project can answer : 
1) How is the amount of time spent by the flight between Taxi out and wheels off affecting the estimated time of arrival? 
2) On what days of the week and a particular time during that day do we observe the maximum delays in flight time?
3) While considering landing delay (at destination), how is flight air time affecting delay time?
4) Analyzing reason for delay(weather delay, technical delay, logistics delay, airline traffic) w.r.t delay time, airline, airport?

## Data and Source Description

- https://www.bts.dot.gov/explore-topics-and-geography/topics/understanding-reporting-causes-flight-delays-and-cancellations-0
- Dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3wuFlxQ8Takyu-aMpnuQjop1yjVf_tA/view?usp=sharing

  The datasest contains features such as Scheduled Departure, Departure Time, Departure Delay, Taxi Out, Air Time, Arrival Time, Arrival Delay, Reason for Delay,     etc.


## Future Enhancements

- We plan to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on flight delays dataset and analyze the data using different visualization techniques.
- We will compare the performances of various machine learning algorithms and identify the algorithm that gives the best result on flight delay dataset.
