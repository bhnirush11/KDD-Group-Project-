## Project Objective
- Flight delays are a modern-day problem. In 2020, 27 % of flights were delayed for at least 15 minutes. Passengers, airlines, and airports all suffer from these delays, which are inconvenient and costly.
- This project requires us to do research into flight delay data in order to gain a better understanding of how commercial aviation operates and to anticipate when delays are likely. 

## Research Questions
### We've compiled a list of potential questions that the project can answer : 
  ### 1) Weather, Climate and Geography :
  - Is it true that airlines are better equipped for harsh temperatures (seasons) than for weather changes?
  - What elements play a role in the flight delay?
  - Is it possible to estimate the delay if we know the weather forecast ahead of time?
  - What can you say about airports in unusual geographic locations in terms of flight delays?
  ### 2) Boarding delays: 
  - What are the issues that cause boarding delays? What is the distribution and its effect on delay?
  - Does the cabin crew size have a correlation with the delay?

## Future Enhancements

We will be web scraping, extracting and pre processing the data gathered.
We will compare multiple models and choose the best model for prediction.
